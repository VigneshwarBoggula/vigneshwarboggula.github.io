    <h3 id="Crafting a Problem Statement">1.1. Crafting a Problem Statement</h3>
    <p>We initially wanted to address the problem of food waste and its environmental consequences. Our original 
        problem statement was, “How might we help mobile-literate home cooks eliminate household food waste and 
        help the environment by managing produce and using the contents of their refrigerators?”. We would later 
        modify this after our insights from user research and interviews.</p>
    <p>Based on this original problem statement, we created a Who, What, Where, and Why table. It allowed us to 
        establish the significance of the issue and identify the stakeholders along with their needs. The table 
        includes articles and statistics to demonstrate the problem's magnitude and significance. This helped us 
        identify the severity of the problem and stakeholders related to our problem statement. It also helped 
        list potential metrics that can be used to measure the success of a solution we would create.</p>
    <div class="image">

    </div>
    <h3 id="Conducting Competitive Analysis">1.2. Conducting Competitive Analysis</h3>
    <p>A competitive analysis helped us understand existing solutions that are used to currently address our problem 
        statement. We described these solutions and if they adequately addressed our problem statement. We analyzed 
        five mobile applications: myfitnesspal, OhAPotato, SuperCook, Yummly, and eatthismuch.</p>

    <h4 id="Visual Analysis">1.2.1. Visual Analysis</h4>
    <div class="image">

    <h4 id="Specific Competitive Analysis">1.2.2. Specific Competitive Analysis</h4>
    <div class="image">
        <img src="../../images/cookin/competitiveanalysis.png" alt="Figma frame of Cookin' recipes list">
    </div>
    <p>Throughout the technologies analyzed, there were multiple and a variety of gaps. A common weakness that 
        all the apps share is their clunky search engines and recipe lists. For all the apps, the user must always 
        type their ingredients into their search engines or pantry lists. To improve the user experience and 
        usability, the apps should allow the user to save ingredients for future use. To solidify that these 
        gaps matter and to look for additional features that users may want, we moved on to interviews.</p>

    <h3 id="User Research Plan and Interview Insights">1.3. User Research Plan and Interview Insights</h3>
    <p>After our competitive analysis, we made our user research plan based on the problems we identified on 
        existing products and to determine user needs and wants from our target demographic. Preliminary work 
        included creating an interview guide, practicing interviewing with our peers, and creating an interview 
        protocol. We ideated multiple questions, before deciding on our interview protocols. Our interviews 
        revealed that our target audience had little to no interest in eliminating food waste. They instead 
        listed other reasons and matters that concerned them the most: convenience, budgeting, user-friendly 
        interface, time-efficiency, and deliciousness.</p>
    
    <h4 id="Interview Insights">1.3.1. Interview Insights</h4>
    <p>Convenience and busy schedules are key factors driving people's decision to eat out over cooking at home. 
        Budgeting is another main concern, people want to manage their expenses effectively, but they overspend 
        on groceries and take-out. Interviews also revealed that recipe apps with simple interfaces that enhance 
        user-friendliness are more likely to be used and preferred. There is also a desire to learn new recipes, 
        but time-consuming recipes and difficulty in following them hinder this. The taste of food is also a 
        priority since people consistently want delicious food so they seek meals that satisfy their wants and 
        preferences. We had many quotes by interviewees that expresses each of the sentiments listed. The following
        are the most representative quote for each topic:</p>
    <h4>Convenience</h4>
    <p> • "If cooking at home was not time-consuming, I would cook more at home. Cooking for me usually takes 3 
        hours which includes prepping, cooking, and washing dishes. 3 hours is a lot of time" (Huan, Interview #1)</p>
    
    <h4>Budgeting</h4>
    <p> • "For a week, I try to keep it around $50-70." They are conscious and active about maintaining their 
        expenses but they do sometimes waste food and therefore money. This is expressed when they state "It's 
        a bit frustrating, especially considering the cost" (Vigneshwar, Interview #2)</p>
    
    <h4>User-Friendly Interface</h4>
    <p> • "Easy to navigate, categorized list of recipes, and the app can suggest recipes based on what I have in 
        my fridge and pantry" (Vigneshwar, Interview #1)</p>
    
    <h4>Time-Efficient</h4>
    <p> • "I would love to learn more recipes outside of what I already know, but it seems like it would take a 
        long time to do so" (Evan, Interview #2)</p>
     
    <h4>Delicious</h4>
    <p> • "Would the app allow me to customize some recipes to my liking? I love spicy food so is there a way it 
        can cater to that"  (Taravee, Interview #1)</p>
    
    <h4 id="Revising the Problem Statement">1.3.2. Revising the Problem Statement</h4>
    <p>Based on these insights, we changed our problem statement. From interviews with the demographic we were 
        trying to appeal to, we realized that young adults and university students are struggling with budgeting 
        and managing food. As they become independent, they prioritize their finances since the cost of living 
        has generally been on the rise while salaries/wages have not been able to keep up. This leads to university 
        students and young adults becoming financially conscious and leaving them with no choice but to prioritize 
        their budgeting over environmental responsibilities. As a result of our findings from our interviews, we 
        changed the problem statement to: How might we help mobile-literate home cooks save money by managing 
        produce and using the contents of their refrigerators?</p>

    <h4 id="Listing Design Goals on Affinity Diagram">1.3.3. Listing Design Goals on Affinity Diagram</h4>
    <p>To define what our application would help our users with, we created an affinity diagram to find key 
        insights into what our consumers would want. After reviewing the entire group's interview results, 
        we listed as many insights as possible. We were then able to narrow down the affinity diagram to 
        highlight the key insights we wanted to go further in-depth and integrate into the design of our app. 
        In the end, we pivoted towards ideas and solutions for a problem statement that better reflects our 
        intended audience needs.</p>
    <div class="image">
        <img src="../../images/cookin/affinitydiagram.png" alt="Figma frame of Cookin' recipes list">
    </div>
    <h4 id="Brainstorming Solutions on Miro Board">1.3.4. Brainstorming Solutions on Miro Board</h4>
    <p>We generated ideas and solutions to our problem statement by listing all of our thoughts on Miro board and 
        prioritizing them. After generating all of our ideas gathered from the interviews, we narrowed down our 
        ideas in terms of feasibility, landing us at the problem statement we have currently. Through this we 
        created a must implement list, which included the grocery list, pantry list, recipe list, and some sort 
        of filtering system. All of these features were later implemented in our final prototype, showing how 
        efficient this process was.</p>
    <div class="image">
        <img src="../../images/cookin/miroboard.png" alt="Figma frame of Cookin' recipes list">
    </div>
    <h3 id="Creating Persona and Storyboards">1.4. Creating Persona and Storyboards</h3>
    <p>The persona and storyboards are based on the insights we gathered from our interviews. Our persona allowed 
        us to better understand the type of users we might cater to. This made us critically think about what 
        elements we might include to solve their pain points. Our storyboards also greatly enhanced our 
        perspective on how an app like ours is able to help people. It allowed us to visualize the steps 
        it might take or frustrations users face.</p>
    <div class="image">
        <img src="../../images/cookin/persona.png" alt="Figma frame of Cookin' recipes list">
    </div>
    <p>Our persona, Dana, represents one of our targeted audiences who would use this application. It allowed us 
        to understand what the user may need, their behavior and their frustrations. Our team used this persona 
        to internalize what features we might want to implement to help our user. After creating the persona, we 
        were able to better determine what our targeted consumers would want.</p>  
    <div class="image">
        <img src="../../images/cookin/storyboard1.png" alt="Figma frame of Cookin' recipes list">
    </div>
    <p>This storyboard is representative of people who have leftover foods that they let spoil because they do 
        not know how to use the ingredients. This is a process that we believe a user would face. Based on 
        interviews such as Evan's interview #1 mentions cheese and milk as foods that quickly spoil and are 
        not used. In Jeffrey's interview #2, the interviewee explains how the recipes they were originally 
        going to cook does not suit their current appetite, so they let the food go to waste. There are also 
        people who just do not know what recipes are available with their ingredients, as evidenced in Evan's 
        interview #2. The storyboard allows us to think about what features we want to implement to help solve 
        the problem this user is specifically facing.</p>
    <div class="image">
        <img src="../../images/cookin/storyboard2.png" alt="Figma frame of Cookin' recipes list">
    </div>
    <p>This storyboard is driven by insights gathered from interviews with individuals such as Vigneshwar's 
        interview #2 and Taravee's interview #1 who struggles with following recipes and desires consistently 
        delicious food. The user is portraying the need to overcome difficulties with recipes. While they are 
        frustrated they still want to improve their skills. The user would also reflect the insight that people 
        seek opportunities to enhance their culinary abilities shown in Huan's interviews #1 and #2. There would 
        be some sort of progress as they gain confidence and mastery in the kitchen, leading to the resolution 
        successfully achieving their goal of consistently delicious meals, supported by data indicating the 
        desire for culinary success and satisfaction.</p>

    <h3 id="Low-Fidelity Prototyping">1.5. Low-Fidelity Prototyping</h3>
    <p>To start this part of our design process, we made several different low-fidelity sketches for the layout 
        of our application. All of these prototypes had their own advantages and disadvantages. As a result, we, 
        as a group, had to deliberate and discuss which key components we wanted to emphasize within our app. 
        After reviewing the sketches, the common theme that we found that were positively impactful was the 
        layout of our screens. With all four sketches, we liked the fact that the information was arranged on 
        each screen and the user should be able to readily know which buttons to click on to satisfy their needs. 
        For example, in the top left image, it offers the key recipe information in order for the user to make a 
        concise decision. Additionally, the “Recipe List” appeals to the user's taste preferences as it offers a 
        filter and search option along with the images and names of recipes that have been outputted. These certain 
        designs simplify the user's previously difficult home cooking experience.</p> 
    <p>Overall, we spent a lot of time making sure our product was easy to use, while still providing as much 
        functionality as possible. We wanted to make sure that we were not leaving out any functions that people 
        would want to use in an application like ours. By the end of our mid-fidelity prototypes, our product was 
        coming together.</p>
    <p>The following are some sketches of the recipes list and pantry list tabs of the app:</p>
    <div class="image">
        <img src="../../images/cookin/lowfidsketches.png" alt="Figma frame of Cookin' recipes list">
    </div>
    <h3 id="Performing Task Analysis">1.6. Performing Task Analysis</h3>
    <p>We created several analyses on how users would actually use our product. To do this analysis, we first made 
        a scenario where our user would use our application in. Then, we made a hierarchy diagram for the scenario. 
        While doing this, we were able to better understand the potential user flows and complexity of our 
        application. We considered the tasks the user and the system would need to perform to address the users 
        needs. Based on our low-fidelity sketches and task analysis, we decided to have four main pages for our 
        mobile app: a recipes list to track all recipes the user saves, a pantry list to track all produce the 
        user currently processes, a grocery list to track all the produce the user needs to get, and a gallery 
        that lets users browse and find recipes which they can add. The following is one of the many task analysis 
        done for a new user attempting to view recipes based on the ingredients they have available:</p>
    <div class="image">
        <img src="../../images/cookin/taskanalysis.png" alt="Figma frame of Cookin' recipes list">
    </div>
    <h3 id="Mid-Fidelity Prototyping">1.7. Mid-Fidelity Prototyping</a></li>
    <p>We tested the initial design ideas by discussing amongst ourselves within the group as well as conducting 
        in-class peer reviews. Generally, the mid-fidelity prototype was well-received by our peers because they 
        believed that our design was very simple, but it was effective in solving the pain points and needs as 
        depicted in the persona and storyboards. The inclusion of a search bar, filters, and sorting options 
        allowed the user to customize their app experience. The simplicity of our prototype is able to enhance 
        user friendliness and usability since the screens are intuitive allowing the users to quickly understand 
        the functionality of each feature.</p>
    <p>However, our prototype also had some suggestions given to us by our peers regarding certain designs along 
        with its functionality. First, peers mentioned that there are certain information that needs to be 
        integrated into the screen in order to provide a better solution to the problem statement. The inclusion 
        of information such as prep time and recipe's level of difficulty can be included in the preview screen 
        in order to increase efficiency and shorten the time it takes the user to find a recipe they would like 
        to cook. Additionally, a peer stated that each of our design features must revert back to our problem 
        statement and ensure that it is effectively solving it. Each design feature must be able to answer the 
        question, “How does this help home cooks make meals at home an easier process?”</p>
    <p>The following are some figma frames from each tab of the app:</p>

    <h4 id="Recipes List1">1.7.1. Recipes List</a></li>

    </div>

    <h3 id="High-Fidelity Prototyping">1.8. High-Fidelity Prototyping</a></li>
    <p>We tested our initial design ideas through reviews from each team member and in-class peers. The reviews 
        had a mix of positive and negative comments. We had many positive feedback regarding the color scheme of 
        our app; people believed that the colors matched the whole food theme which was our original intention. 
        However, there was one aspect where adjustments needed to be made regarding coloring. People believed that 
        the gray dropdown menus were too contrasting against the color scheme of our app. The gray clashed with 
        the yellow and orange which received criticism.</p>
    <p>Additionally, the sizing of the dropdown menus should be changed in order to match the width of the entire 
        screen. With the difference in sizing, it enhances usability because the selection area becomes larger 
        thus decreasing the likelihood of misclicks. Also, we received suggestions regarding “Call to Action” 
        designs such as the design of our “Add” button on our dietary restrictions. It was noted that the “Add” 
        button blended in with the rest of the screen and it was not obvious to the user that the button was there 
        for them to put to use. By keeping this concept in mind throughout the entire design process, we, as 
        designers, can somewhat influence the users to take advantage of most, if not every, design feature.</p>
    <p>Lastly, we received positive feedback on certain design implementations that enhanced the user experience 
        and simplified the home cooking process for them. The inclusion of video tutorials within our view recipe 
        screen was well received since the purpose of it was to guide beginning home cooks through recipes in 
        order to ensure that their meals are as ideal as possible. Also, the variety of filters that we included 
        implied that users' taste preferences were a high priority of ours which it was. By including a set list 
        of filters and allowing users to manually search for filters, the app becomes customizable for each user.

    <h2 id="Final Design Solution">2. Final Design Solution</h2>
    <p>After multiple iterative design and development processes, the final result of our designed work was a 
        high fidelity prototype. The final result of the design work for Cookin' is a user-friendly, 
        feature-rich interface that empowers users to manage their recipes, pantry and grocery lists efficiently. 
        This comprehensive and intuitive interface also enables users to view individual recipes when cooking, 
        and explore recipes that are public. Whether they are looking for quick Ready-to-Cook options or want to 
        find new recipes, the navigation tab provides seamless navigation between the Recipes List, Pantry, 
        Groceries and Public Recipes tabs. The clean and intuitive design enhances the user experience, making 
        it a valuable tool for anyone passionate about cooking and meal planning.</p>

    <h3 id="Recipes List3">2.3. Recipes List</a></li>
    <p>The Recipes List tab offers a comprehensive and intuitive interface for users to manage their recipes 
        efficiently. One of the main features is to view recipes by categories. The Ready-to-Cook category 
        displays recipes that can be made currently based on available ingredients the user listed in the 
        Pantry tab. The All Recipes category shows all recipes the user added. The Most Recent category shows 
        recipes that users added or viewed recently. The Favorites category lists recipes marked as favorites 
        for quick access. The Trash category is where deleted recipes can be temporarily stored before permanent 
        deletion.</p>   
    <p>There are also several viewing options to change the format the recipes are displayed in: grid form and 
        list form. The grid view allows users to view recipes in a grid layout for a visual overview, while the 
        list view displays recipes in a list format for detailed information. There are also sorting and filtering 
        abilities. Users can sort and filter recipes by cooking time, difficulty to make, alphabetical order and 
        easy search. There is always a search bar which users can manually type in to manually find a recipe by 
        its name.</p>
    <p>Recipes can be added to the user's list in multiple ways. Users can scan recipes using their device's camera 
        for quick entry or have the option to select images from the camera roll for recipe entry. They can also 
        input a URL to import recipes from websites. Another option is to compose manually which provides a form 
        to enter their recipe details manually for customization.</p>

    <h3 id="Recipe View3">2.4. Recipe View</a></li>
    <p>Each recipe can be clicked on and viewed individually. Clicking on a recipe card opens a detailed view with 
        its image, description, duration, difficulty, serving size, ingredients and instructions. Users can checkmark 
        ingredients in their possessions or they are automatically marked if they are present in the Pantry tab. 
        They can also checkmark instructions that they have completed. There is also a drop down menu, accessible 
        through the three dot icon in the top right corner. In it, the user has the ability to add the recipe to 
        “Public Recipes”, reset the check mark progress of the recipe, favorite the recipe, add the ingredients of 
        the recipe to the grocery list, view its nutritional information, edit the recipe, and delete the recipe. 
        Lastly, there is a video option, accessible through the video icon in the top right corner. Clicking the 
        video icon will let an instructional video pop out to show how the recipe is meant to be cooked.</p>

    <h3 id="Pantry List3">2.5. Pantry List</a></li>
    <p>The pantry list provides a simple interface for the user to view, edit, and add ingredients. Additionally, 
        they are able to filter which ingredients they want to see by category, as ingredients may add up over time. 
        Finally, they are also able to search for ingredients in their pantry list for the same reason. While viewing 
        a specific ingredient in the pantry list, the user can see the details of the ingredient, including the name, 
        quantity, description, and expiration dates. The user can also edit some of the information if they choose to. 
        Next, the user can add ingredients in three ways: receipts, online search, or manually. Scanning receipts 
        allows the user to batch add ingredients they have recently purchased, online search allows users to find 
        ingredients from online sources, and manual adding allows the user to fully customize the details of the 
        ingredient they want to add. Finally, the user can collapse the categories of the ingredients for a better 
        viewing experience.</p>

    <h3 id="Grocery List2">2.6. Grocery List</a></li>
    <p>The grocery list is a way for users to keep track of the items they may buy. Users are able to add items from 
        a grid like page that includes pictures, average price and an option to increase the quantity of the item. 
        There is also an option to search for ingredients where the application would populate multiple items that 
        they had searched for. They are able to add the item to the list. The list would include everything they 
        added, a budget amount at the top, an option to add more items, and the ability to delete the list if they 
        want to restart. The list has an option to check and uncheck items they may have already bought. This allows 
        the user to be able to keep track of all the items they would need.</p>

    <h3 id="Browse Recipes2">2.7. Browse Recipes</a></li>
    <p>Users can view community recipes, which are recommended to the user based on their recipe lists, recipes 
        interacted with (checkmarked ingredients, favorites, etc.) and other preferences options listed in the 
        browse recipes tab. With each recipe, the user has the choice to either save the recipe or mark it as 
        “not interested.” This functionality will allow users to slowly curate the recipes they find in the 
        community tab to be more and more in line with their personal preferences. On the top right of the screen, 
        the user can press on the triple dot icon to filter by cuisine and/or dietary restrictions. In the cuisine 
        filter, the user can currently filter between American, Vietnamese, Italian, Mediterranean, and Japanese foods. 
        In the dietary filters, the user can select their allergies or eating preferences. Under both categories, the 
        user has the ability to use the search bar menu to find other cuisines and/or dietary restrictions that they 
        would like to add to their personal profile.</p>

    <h2 id="Future Work">3. Future Work</h2>
    <p>If more resources were available to enhance Cookin', there are multiple features each with actionable 
        steps that can improve its functionality: tagging system for recipes, user-created recipe categories, 
        and general enhancement of recipe functionality. These features and functionalities can provide users 
        with a more robust and personalized cooking experience. It enhances recipe discovery, organization, and 
        interaction. This can make the cooking more enjoyable and efficient for users of all levels.</p>

    <h3 id="Tagging System">3.1. Tagging System</h3>
    <p>The first feature to implement will be a tagging system which involves several actionable steps. 
        User-friendly tagging interfaces will allow users to effortlessly add tags to their recipes, 
        such as cuisine, dietary, holidays/special occasions, and price. The tagging system will be integrated 
        with the filtering and sorting functionality and the app's search and browsing functions. This will give 
        users the ability to easily and conveniently filter recipes based on these tags, thereby facilitating 
        the discovery of recipes that align with their preferences.</p>

    <h3 id="User-Created Recipe Categories">3.2. User-Created Recipe Categories</h3>
    <p>The inclusion of category management will offer users the ability to create their own custom recipe 
        categories. This feature would also include options to edit and delete categories as needed, providing 
        a personalized organization system tailored to each user's preferences. A drag-and-drop interface will 
        enable an intuitive way for users to add recipes to their custom categories. This interface would allow 
        users to easily organize their recipes according to their chosen categories, improving the overall 
        usability and efficiency of the app. To ensure a seamless user experience, the custom categories would 
        be designed to sync across devices. This feature would enable users to access their organized recipes 
        from any device, ensuring that their personalized categories are always available whenever and wherever 
        they need them.</p>

    <h3 id="Enhance View Recipe Functionality">3.3. Enhance View Recipe Functionality</h3>
    <p>A rating and feedback system will allow users to provide ratings and leave comments on recipes they've tried. 
        This system not only helps users make informed choices but also provides valuable insights for other users 
        browsing the app. Another addition will be the recipe import feature that would enable users to import 
        recipes from other cooking sites or apps. This functionality would involve parsing recipe data from various 
        formats and automatically populating the app with imported recipes, expanding the app's recipe library. 
        Additionally, a voice-generated recipes feature will enable users to verbally describe a recipe. The app 
        would then convert this description into a formatted recipe card, streamlining the process of adding new 
        recipes.</p>
    <p>There will also be more features when viewing a specific recipe: timers, serving size scaling, and pinning 
        active recipes. Users can set timers for cooking steps directly within the app for better time management. 
        Serving size scaling will allow users to adjust recipe servings and automatically scale ingredient quantities 
        accordingly. A pinning active recipes feature will allow users to "pin" or mark recipes they are currently 
        cooking. This would create a designated section in the app where users can easily access and reference their 
        active recipes. All these additions will improve organization and usability.</p>
